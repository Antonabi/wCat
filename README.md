# wCat
This is a little script that lets you see the title and instructions of an unpuplished scratch project.
# Requirements
To use wcat you have to have [python installed](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
Also you have to have installed `requests` and `scratchattach`.   
This is how you install a python library:
```
pip install libraryName
```

# How this thing works
This remixes the unpublished project, what lets you get the project name and instructions. To get the project itself, you still need the token.
(The name comes from "who Cares about tokens" because scratches last api change made it imposible to get the projects token when it is unpublished. The token is needed to get the project file and info.)
